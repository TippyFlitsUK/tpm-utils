# Specification Quality Checklist: Export project board items to CSV

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-06  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Record

**Iteration 1 (2026-04-06)**: Reviewed spec against all items above. No failing items. Spec uses “utility” and “CSV” as user-requested delivery shape; avoids stack-specific APIs. FR-009 and Assumptions document zero-match and missing-field behavior to keep requirements testable.

## Notes

- Plan phase may map “URL or equivalent locator” and “filter” to concrete CLI flags and the target board product’s concepts.

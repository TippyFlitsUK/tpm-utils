# FilOz TPM Utilities

This repository contains various scripts and documentation to help [FilOz](https://www.filoz.org/) Technical Program Managers (TPMs) with weekly reporting, investigations, and other operational tasks.

## Overview

FilOz TPMs regularly need to:
- Generate reports on GitHub pull requests and development activity
- Find and analyze Filecoin Slack conversations related to specific miner IDs
- Track storage provider issues and communications
- Investigate technical problems across the Filecoin ecosystem

This repository provides tools and workflows to streamline these tasks.

## Available Tools & Documentation

### 📊 GitHub PR Report Generator
**File:** [GITHUB_PR_REPORT_GENERATOR.md](GITHUB_PR_REPORT_GENERATOR.md)

Generate comprehensive reports of GitHub pull requests across repositories, with filtering capabilities for date ranges, repositories, and specific criteria. Useful for weekly development activity summaries.

### 🔍 Slack Miner ID Search Workflow
**File:** [FINDING_MINERIDS_ON_SLACK.md](FINDING_MINERIDS_ON_SLACK.md)

Complete workflow for finding relevant Filecoin Slack messages related to specific miner IDs. Includes:
- Automated searching across Slack channels
- Filtering out automated chain messages
- Post-processing to focus on human conversations
- Clean markdown report generation

This is particularly useful for investigating storage provider issues and tracking community discussions.

### 📢 FOC-WG PR Notifier
**File:** `foc_wg_pr_notifier.py`

Automated daily notification system that fetches open PRs from [FilOzone GitHub Project 14 (View 32)](https://github.com/orgs/FilOzone/projects/14/views/32) and posts a formatted summary to the `#foc-bots` Slack channel.

**Features:**
- Queries GitHub Project 14 via GraphQL API
- Applies View 32 filters (excludes "Done" status, specific milestones)
- Groups PRs by repository
- Posts formatted Slack messages with PR details
- Runs automatically via GitHub Actions (see [./github/workflows/fog-wg-pr-notifier.yml](fog-wg-pr-notifier.yml))

**Testing:**

1. **Local dry-run test** (recommended first step):
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token python foc_wg_pr_notifier.py --dry-run
   ```
   This will fetch PRs and show the message that would be posted without actually sending to Slack.

2. **Local full test** (posts to Slack):
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook python foc_wg_pr_notifier.py
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions test**:
   - Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/FilOzone/tpm-utils/actions) in the repository
   - Select "FOC-WG PR Notifier" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Choose "true" for dry_run to test without posting, or "false" to post to Slack
   - Click "Run workflow" button

***Periodic Runs:***
This notifier is scheduled to run periodically per [./github/workflows/fog-wg-pr-notifier.yml](fog-wg-pr-notifier.yml).

GraphQL fetch logic for Project 14 lives in [`foc_project14_client.py`](foc_project14_client.py) (shared with the FOC PR report).

### 📋 FOC PR report (Markdown)
**Directory:** [foc-pr-report/](foc-pr-report/)

Generates a Markdown table of PR workload on [Project 14 / View 2](https://github.com/orgs/FilOzone/projects/14/views/2): counts per GitHub user and board status (excludes Done and Todo), with deep links for each cell. Run with **`uv`**:

```bash
cd foc-pr-report && uv sync && GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token uv run foc-pr-report -o report.md
```

See [foc-pr-report/README.md](foc-pr-report/README.md).

### 📤 GitHub project TSV export
**Directory:** [github-project-export/](github-project-export/)

Export board items from an organization Project (v2) to **TSV** using a **JSON** file (filter, columns, and stdout vs file path all live in the config—no duplicate CLI flags). Uses the REST list-items API with server-side `q`, shared with the FOC PR report client.

```bash
cd github-project-export && uv sync && GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) uv run github-project-export examples/export.example.json
```

See [github-project-export/README.md](github-project-export/README.md).

### 🎯 GitHub Milestone Manager
**Directory:** [github-milestone-creator/](github-milestone-creator/)

Tool for creating and updating GitHub milestones across multiple repositories from a JSON configuration file. Supports syncing milestones from reference repositories, automatic milestone matching, renaming, and detailed change tracking.

**Key Features:**
- Create/update milestones across multiple repos
- Sync milestones from reference repositories (source of truth)
- Automatic milestone matching by name
- Milestone renaming support
- JSON schema validation with comment support
- Dry-run mode for safe testing
- Detailed output showing previous → new values
